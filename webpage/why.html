<title>Why weird characters break the downloader</title>

<h1>
Why can't I view a list of results and pick one?
</h1>
<center>
	<p>The tool this site uses to actually download the video/audio from youtube is equipped with a very handy search feature, however by default it only finds and downloads the first result.
	</p>
	<p> I'm sure with some tinkering I could make it show a list of results, but I figured why reinvent the wheel? That'd be a lot of effort for something really not that important.
	</p>
	<p>
	99% of the time the first result is the one you want and this just streamlines that process. If you really want a specific video, the copy and paste works just fine.

<h1>
Why can I only use alpha-numeric characters in a search?
</h1>
</center>

<p>
<p>
Certain characters have a significance in the scripting languages that this tool is built with.
</p>

<p>
Apostrophies, quotation marks, parentheses, brackets, and curly braces are all grouping symbols (much like in algebra) interpretted by the scripts
</p>

<p>
As of now this tool simply passes along whatever you type for your search, without any effort to change any grouping symbols into a script-safe alternative
</p>

<p>
This means that if you use any of those characters or others not listed, they will be interpretted as part of the script. Since you will most likely use only one of the grouping symbols it will typically throw up an "Unmatched grouping symbol" error.
</p>

<p>
This technically is a vulnerablility since you could probably get my machine to run arbitrary code by abusing this "bug". Oh well.
